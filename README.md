## Acknowledgments

* Other than me needing the functionality, hat tip to the #ukbimcrew for all the BS1192 debates on Twitter that inspired me to release this.

* The codebase is in no way striving for efficiency, but instead simplicity & legibility for the community's benefit - hence the many comments left throughout the code. Any suggestions or help improving it is warmly welcomed.
